- See that you have `Python` installed.
- Clone this repository.
- Create a new Python environment and install the dependencies in it. This can be done as follows:
  - Open `command prompt` and `cd` to the directory where you have cloned the repo.
  - Run the command `Python -m venv env` to create a new virtual environment named `env`
  - Activate the enviroment by running the command `env\Scripts\activate.bat`
  - Install depencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br> 

The above steps will create a python virtual environment and install the required depndencies in it. Now whenever you want to run the app, follow these steps:
- Open `command prompt` and `cd` to the directory where you have cloned the repo.
- Activate the python environment by running the command `env\Scripts\activate.bat`.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE APP
Upon running the app, your webcam will be turned on and will be used to track your hand and fingers. As of now, you can only use your right hand to use this app. Support for left hand is coming soon.
This app works in 4 modes:
- Pointer Mode
- Left Click Mode
- Right Click Mode
- Scrolling Mode

### Pointer Mode
This mode will be triggered when only your index finger is up, while the rest are down. In this mode you can move around your index finger to move the cursor on screen

### Left Click Mode
This mode will be triggered when your index and middle fingers are up while rest are down. While in this mode, bring your index and middle fingers closer to perform a typical mouse left-click.

### Right Click Mode
This mode will be triggered when your index finger and thumb are up while rest of the fingers are down. While in this mode, bring your index finger and thumb closer to perform a typical mouse right-click.

### Scrolling Mode
This mode will be triggered when your index, ring and middle fingers are up while rest of the fingers are down. While in this mode, move your ring finger away from your middle finger to scroll up and move your index finger away from your middle finger to scroll down.
